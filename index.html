I am a linguist at ZAS, Berlin. 

I am interested in studying the distributional and referential properties of different noun phrases in Italian and other Romance languages using  experimental methods to strengthen the empirical basis, and the toolbox of syntax and semantics for the analysis. 

My recent work concerns Italian partitives and proportions. My papers are available on LingBuzz: https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/_search?q=falco
